Description: A robust identification of differential binding sites method for analyzing ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing) 
    comparing two samples that considers an ensemble of finite mixture models combined with a local false discovery rate (fdr) 
    allowing for flexible modeling of data. Methods for Differential Identification using Mixture Ensemble (DIME) is described in: 
    Taslim et al., (2011) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr165>.
